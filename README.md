benchmark-hundred-step is an open-source AI model benchmark for long-horizon tasks. It measures this behavior: Reliability across 25 to 100 dependent steps.

```bash
npx benchmark-hundred-step run --model offline --provider mock --json
```

```json
{"model":"mock:1","mean":0.5,"totals":{"tasks":2,"passed":1,"failed":0}}
```

The starter data comes from a committed seeded generator. Seed 20261015 reproduces the public tasks.

## Install

benchmark-hundred-step requires Node.js 20 or newer.

```bash
npm install benchmark-hundred-step
```

## Run your first benchmark

The mock provider needs no key or network access.

```bash
npx benchmark-hundred-step run --model offline --provider mock
```

A successful run prints two scored rows and a mean of 0.5.

## How it works

```text
tasks.jsonl -> model adapter -> deterministic grader -> report
                         |-> CLI / SDK / MCP / HTTP API
```

The runner keeps task order and records score, reason, latency, retries, usage, and cost when available.

## Why it exists

General model leaderboards do not isolate long-horizon behavior. This package keeps the task data, grading rules, and provenance together for inspection.

The E2E gate checks every listed surface against the package source.

## Common use cases

1. **Model developers:** compare adapters with the same seeded tasks.
2. **Agent developers:** inspect task-level failures before changing prompts.
3. **Release teams:** run the mock gate before publishing a data update.
4. **Researchers:** export per-task scores for a reproducible analysis.

## Features

- **Deterministic grading:** Each row includes a score and reason.
- **Reproducible data:** A committed seeded script creates the public tasks.
- **Share cards:** The `card` command writes a 1200×630 SVG.
- **Provenance:** Code and Markdown carry the same source record.

## SDK

```ts
import { benchmark, run, score } from "benchmark-hundred-step";
```

`run(adapter, options)` creates a report. `score(taskId, submission)` grades one trace.

## CLI

Commands are `list`, `show`, `run`, `score`, `card`, `provenance`, `index-entry`, `serve`, and `mcp`. Pass `--json` for machine-readable output.

## Model Context Protocol

Start the MCP stdio server:

```bash
npx benchmark-hundred-step mcp
```

Tools are `list_tasks`, `get_task`, `score_answer`, `run_benchmark`, and `get_provenance`.

## HTTP API

Import `handler` from `benchmark-hundred-step/api`, or run `npx benchmark-hundred-step serve`. Routes are `GET /health`, `GET /v1/tasks`, `GET /v1/tasks/:id`, `POST /v1/score`, `GET /v1/provenance`, and `GET /v1/index-entry`.

## Data provenance

`data/tasks.jsonl` contains the public tasks. `data/PROVENANCE.md` names the generator, seed, licence, cutoff, and refresh steps. Run `npm run generate:tasks` to rebuild tasks and `npm run provenance` after a build.

## Limits

The starter tasks prove package wiring, not model quality. Replace them before publishing a real benchmark. Public tasks can enter training data. Keep a separately seeded hidden split for final comparisons. Remote providers can add cost and retain prompts under their own policies.

## Status

Version 0.1.0 is alpha. Task schemas and grading may change before 1.0. Report defects through the GitHub issue tracker. Public case studies are not yet published.

## FAQ

### What does benchmark-hundred-step measure?

benchmark-hundred-step measures this behavior: Reliability across 25 to 100 dependent steps. The committed grader defines the exact pass conditions.

### Can benchmark-hundred-step run offline?

benchmark-hundred-step runs end to end with the mock provider and no key. Real model runs need a configured provider.

### Which providers work?

benchmark-hundred-step supports OpenRouter, an OpenAI-compatible base URL, and the offline mock adapter through benchmark-core.

### Does benchmark-hundred-step provide a hosted service?

benchmark-hundred-step provides a server you run. It does not provide a managed benchmark service.

### Where do the tasks come from?

benchmark-hundred-step ships seeded synthetic starter tasks. The provenance file explains how to reproduce and refresh them.

### How are answers graded?

benchmark-hundred-step uses exact match for single answers and simulator replay for episode traces. Model judging is off.

### How is this different from a general leaderboard?

benchmark-hundred-step measures one named behavior with inspectable tasks and grading. General leaderboards combine broader capabilities.

### Can I use a hidden split?

benchmark-hundred-step supports the same schema for public and hidden tasks. Keep hidden data outside the npm package and public repository.
