# Working on benchmark-hundred-step

## Commands

- Install with `npm ci`.
- Run the full gate with `npm run ci:local`.
- Generate tasks with `npm run generate:tasks`.
- Generate provenance after building with `npm run provenance`.
- Add no unit tests. Extend `scripts/e2e.mjs` through a public surface.

## Contracts

Keep tasks, deterministic grading, and provenance in sync. Episode environments must be seeded. Grade episode traces by replaying their tool log.

Never read provider keys from repository files. OpenRouter uses `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. OpenAI-compatible providers use `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Open an issue before a branch. Use `bhun-<issue>-<slug>` and `[bhun-<issue>] Imperative subject`. Keep pull requests below 500 counted lines. Do not merge your own pull request or push `release`.
